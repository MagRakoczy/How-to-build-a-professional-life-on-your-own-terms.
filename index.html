                    Trying to work as a programmer    seems like a great idea to me.
                    In a way, it will fulfill my dreams of creating creative things that are supposed to serve people in some way. I will be in constant contact with other employees. I will be able to work remotely, which will allow me some independence, flexible working hours, convenience, and spending more time with the rest of the household.
